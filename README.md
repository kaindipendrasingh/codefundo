Blockchain

•	We would create an online portal through blockchain mechanism.

•	The portal would first ask to login using our mobile no., aadhaar card number, and a pan card number.

•	After login we can create our e – voting card, using aadhar card number, birth date(which would be verified by aadhar card and pan card) and our finger print( which would be verified by finger print on aadhar card).

•	All these information will be stored in a block as a data.

•	SHA256 would convert these data in a hash number of 32 bits.

•	First 12 digits of a hash number will be our voter id.

•	This voter id would be sent to the voter through his mobile number.

•	After this voter can print his voter id by clicking on download voter id, id will include his/hers voter id number, aadhar card number,  mobile number and the constituency he/she belongs to .

•	Then comes the most important step of casting a vote.

•	To cast a vote, voter has to sign in to the portal using aadhaar card number and finger print.

•	Then a list of contestants will be displayed. 

•	After selecting a contestant, vote will be casted only once. The name of contestant, voter id number and his/hers constituency will be given as input to the block chain. These data will be stored in a block.
